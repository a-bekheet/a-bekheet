**ML Systems Engineer** with a background in Engineering Physics from Queen's University.

The physics taught me to reason about complex systems. I apply that now to production ML infrastructure. I build multi-agent systems, optimize inference pipelines, and design RAG architectures that actually scale.

Currently at **FusionMinds.ai** building AI tools that make ESG reporting accessible, using LangGraph, LangSmith, and NVIDIA NIM.

Always open to collaborating on interesting projects.
