## 🌟 About Me

Throughout my journey as an engineering student, I have embraced roles that challenge me to lead, innovate, and collaborate. From **developing neural network models for optical physics** to **streamlining logistics for large-scale engineering events**, my experiences highlight my adaptability and passion for impact-driven work.

Here are a few highlights of my journey:
- 📡 **Blending Engineering & Physics**: I have modeled diffraction patterns with neural networks, solved quantum mechanical problems numerically, and developed embedded systems for real-world applications.  
- 🛠️ **Leadership & Collaboration**: As **Vice President of Student Affairs**, I managed a $2.3 million budget and led a 1,200-member organization at Queen’s University.  
- 🌍 **Global Perspective**: From representing Egypt at the **World Scout Jamboree** to leading teams in Canada, I excel in multicultural, high-impact environments.

Currently, I’m seeking roles in **machine learning engineering**, **AI systems development**, or **optics-based technology** to bring my technical skills and creative problem-solving to cutting-edge projects.
